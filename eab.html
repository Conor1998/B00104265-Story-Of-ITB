<h1>Ecology & Biodiversity</h1>
<div class="gal1">
<p>Much of the original fauna and flora of the local area can still be found on the college grounds. The ITB campus provides many habitats for different plants and animals. The vegetation in the area is ideal for rabbits, many 
can be seen around the grass areas on campus. The local enviroment also attracts predators such as buzzards and foxes. They use these grassland areas to hunt.
 </p>

<div class="gal2">
<p>The ecology and biodiversity of the surrounding areas has vastly developed 
because it was origionally used as farmland. Amenity grassland, wildflower meadows, copses of trees, and hedgerows can all be found on campus. The land is well drained thanks to our sustainable drainage ditches. Many different types of mushrooms grow around the grass areas of the college especially after 
spells of rain. We get a variation of them because there are all sorts of different habitats on the grounds. Our green scrublands sprout with flowers from May to September and fruits from August to October.
