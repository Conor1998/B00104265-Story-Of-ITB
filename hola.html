<h1>History of Local Area</h1>
<div class="gal1">
<p>The local area around the college has a rich history. It was originally just farmland before any housing estates or business parks were built.
 A lot of Blanchardstown was once covered by a dense forest. This dense forest was known as the GreatScaldwald. Wolves and wild boar once lived here until they were all hunted by the local people.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="gal2">
<p>Over time the area became more built up, this eventually 
led to the construction of ITB. The first housing estates began to be developed in the late 1960s. The Blanchardstown shopping center was built in 1996 and is now Ireland's most popular retail park. This brought many jobs to the area and has played a key role in the growth of the local area. Since 1996 the area's population 
has grown by 37%. ITB was built in an ideal location because the shopping center and business parks are close by in the surrounding area. These business parks have helped create job opportunities for students studying in ITB.

<div class="gal3">
<p> Thanks to the Parish Register for Blanchardstown, there is a great record of all the families who lived in the area. This register goes all the way back to the 1750s. Using
these records we can tell that the land ITB sits on was once owned by a goat farmer.
